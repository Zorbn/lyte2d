API code generation
-------------------
- Source of truth for Lyte2D APIs is programatically defined in the defs_lyte.lua file.
- Files are generated in the output folder
- From there, they should be copied (carefully, manually, for now) to their final location
- Careful, some files are edited (like enums values)
